Every Quest can have subtasks. When all the tasks are completed for a quest the Quest can be completed for rewards. 


Every Quest complited grants the user with Exp or gold coins. 

The ammount to of Exp or gold a Quest grands depends on is auomatically calculated based on how hard the title of the quest seems.


When a user gains enought Exp, it can level up. 
As the user levels up he earns new badges and titles. 
Badges are diplayed in the user profile.
