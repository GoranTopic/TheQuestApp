## About 
This is a To-do with an epic twist. 
Inpired in the Witcher 3, The Quest App allows the user to set Quest intead of task.
Every Quest can have subtasks. When all the tasks are completed for a quest the Quest can be completed for rewards. 

Every Quest complited grants the user with Exp or gold coins. 
The ammount to of Exp or gold a Quest grands depends on is auomatically calculated based on how hard the title of the quest seems.


When a user gains enought Exp, it can level up. 
As the user levels up he earns new badges and titles. 
Badges are diplayed in the user profile. 
With money the user can buy titles, witch are displayed underneath the user's name.
